# Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Apache-Spark-for-Enhanced-Risk-Management.

Loan default prediction is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risks and optimize lending
decisions. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Apache Spark to develop a scalable
and accurate predictive model for identifying potential loan defaulters.

The model utilizes historical loan data, including demographic details, financial behavior, and the form of transaction records. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed using Spark MLlib for efficient large-scale processing. Multiple machine learning algorithms,
including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, catboost,xgboost algo and Neural Networks, are trained and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy,Recall.
